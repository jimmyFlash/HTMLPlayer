        <li><strong>•</strong> Asthma medicines come in a range of different shaped containers (devices).Some asthma medicines come
   in more than one type of device. </li>
           
        <li><strong>•</strong> There are several types of devices: Puffers, Spacers, Spacers and Masks, Acculhalers, Turbuhalers and  Autohalers.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> A puffer has a plastic L-shaped outer case and a metal canister that fits inside it. The metal canister contains
   the medication and a propellant to push the medication out.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> A puffer advantages: minimizing side effects and deliver medication more effectively to lungs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Puffer disadvantages: Very young children may not physically be able to use them alone without a spacer,
   some people require little hand strength and may have trouble coordinating the start of their breath in with
   pressing the puffer.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Spacers: assist with taking asthma medication and are only needed with  puffers, they reduce amount of medicine
   that lands mouth and allowing more to go down into lungs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Spacers disadvantages: bulky limiting portability and medication deposition less dose received.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Spacers and Masks: are used for very young children to ensure medication is breathed into lungs.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Dry powdered Inhalers (DPI): are inhalers that deliver medication in a dry powder form, including:
  Acculhalers, Turbuhalers.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Accuhalers: round plastic devices that have medication inside them in the form of a dry powder, while Turbuhalers
  are a tube-shaped inhaler which has the medication inside with removable cover and a twisting base.
  Both are ‘breath-activated which means the medication is ‘sucked’.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> DPI advantages: Small and portable, breath actuated, less patient co-ordination required, Short treatment time
   and available for most substances.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> DPI disadvantages: Moderate to high inspiratory flow required, not suited for children < 4 years and not be appropriate
   for emergency situations and Not suitable for delivering large doses.</li>
   
           <li><strong>•</strong> Autohalers: has an L-shaped plastic outer case, a metal canister inside, and a lever at the top.
   This is an automatic device, so it automatically ‘fires’ the medication when it senses you breathing in through
   the mouthpiece. Autohalers can be very useful to people who have trouble with the timing and coordination that
   is needed to use a puffer, because you only need to be able to seal your lips around the mouthpiece and breathe in.</li>
