        <li><strong>•</strong> Asthma is a public health problem occurring in all countries regardless of the level of development affecting
           235 million people.</li>
           
        <li><strong>•</strong> Asthma is the most common noncommunicable disease among children.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Asthma is a complex syndrome characterized by Airway Hyper-responsiveness (AH) and is caused by 
        a multicellular inflammatory reaction that leads to airway obstruction.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> There are 2 types of asthma: allergic and non-allergic.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> In non allergic asthma non-TH2 cells and various cells of the immune system other than TH2 cells contribute 
        to non-allergic asthma.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Allergic asthma can be induced by allergens and is mediated by TH2 immune responses. </li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Following exposure to an allergen, a series of initial reactions in the immune system occurs called the allergic cascade.<br />  
        This early-phase response is followed by a second, more severe reaction known as a late-phase response.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Airflow limitation in asthma is recurrent and caused by a variety of changes in the airway. These include:
               <ul>
                    <li>- Bronchoconstriction</li>
                    <li>- Airway edema</li>
                    <li>- Airway hyperresponsiveness</li>
                    <li>- Airway remodeling</li>
               </ul>
		</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Airway inflammation has a central role in the pathophysiology of asthma which involves an interaction of many
           cell types and multiple mediators with the airways that eventually results in the characteristic
           pathophysiological features of the disease.</li>
           
        <li><strong>•</strong> Common signs and symptoms of asthma include: Coughing, Wheezing, Chest tightness and Shortness of breath.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Exacerbations (asthma attacks) are acute or subacute episodes, which are characterized by a progressive increase
           in one or more typical asthma symptoms accompanied by a decrease in expiratory flow (PEF or FEV1).</li>
           
        <li><strong>•</strong> There are 2 types of exacerbations:
                <ul>
                    <li>- Those that are slow to develop (normally over a period of days or weeks).</li>
                    <li>- Those that develop quickly (in less than 3 hours).</li>
                    <li>- The intensity of exacerbations varies from mild to life-threatening.</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
