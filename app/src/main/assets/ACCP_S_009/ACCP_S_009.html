        <li><strong>•</strong> The long-term goals of asthma management are: Achieving good control of symptoms , maintaining normal activity
   levels and minimizing future risk of exacerbations, fixed airflow limitation and side-effects.</li>
           
        <li><strong>•</strong> Effective asthma management relies on three different strategies:</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> The patient-health care provider partnership enabling asthma patients to gain the knowledge to assume a major role
   in the management of their asthma improving patient outcomes.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Good communication by health care providers increasing patient satisfaction and adherence.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> Health literacy and asthma: The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process & understand basic
   health information and services to make appropriate health decisions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> In choosing between treatment options at a population level:
        
        		<ul>
                	<li>- The ‘preferred’ medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness,
     safety, Availability and cost at the population level.</li>
        			<li>- Choosing between controller options for individual patients is based on Preferred treatment for symptom control
    and risk reduction, Patient characteristics and preference as well as practical issues.</li>
        		</ul>
         </li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong>  Risk factors are factors that increase the patient’s future risk of having exacerbations (flare-ups), loss of lung function,
   or medication side-effects.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong> In control-based asthma management, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment is adjusted in
   a continuous cycle that involves assessment, treatment and review.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong>Patients with asthma should be reviewed regularly.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong>Stepping up the treatment contains: Day-to-day adjustment, Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)
   and Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks).</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong>For setting down the treatment: Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 3 months and
   lung function has reached a plateau, treatment can often be successfully reduced, without loss of asthma control.</li>
        
        <li><strong>•</strong>Indications for considering referral for expert advice include: Suspected occupational Asthma, Difficulty confirming
   the diagnosis of asthma, Persistent uncontrolled asthma  or frequent exacerbations or Evidence of, risk of,
   significant treatment side-effects, any risk factors for  asthma-related death, Symptoms suggesting  complications
   or  sub-types of asthma, as well as additional reasons for referral in children 6–11 years.</li>
